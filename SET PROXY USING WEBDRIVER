I am currently at the London Tester Gathering Workshops in a session being hosted by Bill Matthews. He is showing the attendees how to use Zap Proxy. During the class he mentioned that you can hook your existing WebDriver checks into a proxy. Something I also mentioned in my recent “WebDriver Beyond Checks” post.

So I thought I would create a quick post showing you how you can do this. I am not using Zap, instead I am using Fiddler, but you just need the right proxy url and change accordingly.

Here is how you do it in C# using Firefox and Chrome drivers.

Firefox
        public void SettingUpAProxyUsingFirefoxDriver()
        {
            //Create a new Firefox profile
            var firefoxProfile = new FirefoxProfile();
            //Create a new proxy object
            var proxy = new Proxy();
            //Set the http proxy value, host and port.
            proxy.HttpProxy = "localhost:8888";
            //We then add this proxt setting to the Firefox profile we created
            firefoxProfile.SetProxyPreferences(proxy);
            //Then create a new Firefox Driver passing in the profile we created
            //WebDriver we open a Firefox using this profile now
            var Driver = new FirefoxDriver(firefoxProfile);

            //Navigate to a url and look at the traffic being logged in Fiddler.
            Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://bbc.co.uk");
        }

Chrome
        public void SettupUpAProxyUsingChromeDriver()
        {
            //Create a chrome options object
            var chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();
            //Create a new proxy object
            var proxy = new Proxy();
            //Set the http proxy value, host and port.
            proxy.HttpProxy = "localhost:8888";
            //Set the proxy to the Chrome options
            chromeOptions.Proxy = proxy;
            //Then create a new ChromeDriver passing in the options
            //ChromeDriver path isn't required if its on your path
            //If it now downloaded it and put the path here
            var Driver = new ChromeDriver(@"C:\Users\Richard\Desktop\", chromeOptions);

            //Navigation to a url and a look at the traffic logged in fiddler
            Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://bbc.co.uk");
        }

Here is how you do it in Java.

Firefox
    public void ProxyUsingFirefoxDriver()
    {
        //Create a new Firefox profile
        FirefoxProfile firefoxProfile = new FirefoxProfile();
        //Then add the proxy setting to the Firefox profile we created
        firefoxProfile.setPreference("network.proxy.http", "localhost");
        firefoxProfile.setPreference("network.proxy.http_port", "8888");
        //Then create a new Firefox Driver passing in the profile we created
        //WebDriver we open a Firefox using this profile now
        FirefoxDriver Driver = new FirefoxDriver(firefoxProfile);

        //Navigate to a url and look at the traffic being logged in Fiddler.
        Driver.navigate().to("http://bbc.co.uk");
    }

Chrome
    public void ProxyUsingChromeDriver()
    {
        //Set the location of the ChromeDriver
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Users\\Richard\\Desktop\\chromedriver.exe");
        //Create a new desired capability
        DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
        // Create a new proxy object and set the proxy
        Proxy proxy = new Proxy();
        proxy.setHttpProxy("localhost:8888");
        //Add the proxy to our capabilities 
        capabilities.setCapability("proxy", proxy);
        //Start a new ChromeDriver using the capabilities object we created and added the proxy to
        ChromeDriver Driver = new ChromeDriver(capabilities);

        //Navigation to a url and a look at the traffic logged in fiddler
        Driver.navigate().to("http://bbc.co.uk");
    }

There you go, you can now add a proxy to your WebDriver checks, and collate lots of information to explore from various proxies available such as, BrowserMob, Fiddler and ZapProxy.

Happy Proxy-ing.
